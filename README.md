# Signature Forgery Detection Using TensorFlow

This project focuses on detecting signature forgeries using deep learning techniques, specifically leveraging TensorFlow for building and training a neural network model. The model is designed to classify whether a given signature is genuine or forged.

## Introduction
Signature forgery detection is an important problem in document verification processes. This project uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze signature images and determine their authenticity. The model is trained on labeled images of genuine and forged signatures.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of two main directories:
- `train`: Contains training images with subfolders for genuine and forged signatures.
- `test`: Contains test images with a similar structure for model evaluation.

The images are pre-processed and resized to a standard format before feeding them into the model.

## Model
The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using TensorFlow and Keras. It includes multiple convolutional layers followed by dense layers for classification.

## Training
The model is trained using the images in the `train` directory. Key techniques include:
- Data augmentation to improve generalization
- Adam optimizer for efficient training
- Early stopping to prevent overfitting

The training process saves the best model based on validation accuracy.

## Evaluation
The trained model is evaluated on the test set. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are used to measure the performance.

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of `XX%` on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting forged signatures.
